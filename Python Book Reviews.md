# Python Book Reviews

### Individual Reviews

#### Everyone Exploring Data
*Python for Everybody* begins by introducing the Python language and basic concepts of programming like conditional execution, functions, and loops. It then moves into more advanced topics like networked programs and object-oriented programming. This book is a good resource for a beginner to Python who may have little or no experience with programming. It seems to do a good job of overviewing the functionality of Python, but it does not focus on any specific applications of the language.

#### Fluent
*Fluent Python* is written for competent Python programmers with the aim of teaching them specifically to code "fluently" in Python 3 - that is, to use Python-specific features that might be unfamiliar because they are not present in other programming languages. As the author notes in the preface, this book is not useful for Python beginners because it assumes a reasonable level of proficiency from the reader.

#### Head First
*Head First Python* is written for programmers coming to Python from another language. It uses a friendly, conversational writing style and strongly encourages engagement with the text and exercises to deepen learning of the language. It is not suitable for total beginners, and it is not a fully comprehensive reference guide.

#### Physical Modeling
*A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling* is suitable for complete beginners approaching programming (and specifically Python) in the concept of scientific modeling. It starts by introducing basic algorithmic thinking and, once a foundation is laid, deals specifically with modeling applications. It is not useful as a comprehensive Python reference.

#### Whirlwind Tour
*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* seeks to be "a brief but comprehensive tour of the Python language" for those already competent in programming with other languages. It is neither an all-encompassing reference book nor a guide for the true beginner to programming.

#### Cython
*Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers* teaches Cython, a Python-to-C compiler. It assumes competence with Python and familiarity with C or C++, and it guides the reader through the performance improvements and other advantages possible with Cython. It is not useful for a programming beginner.

#### Scipy Lectures
These lecture notes, presented in outline format, aim to provide an education in using Python for scientific applications. They assume knowledge of programming and moves from a basic overview of the language into advanced topics using Numpy, Scipy, and other tools. They are useful for scientists, but not necessarily for other Python programmers.

#### Codecademy
This interactive, online tutorial starts by assuming no knowledge of programming. Its hands-on approach encourages the user to immediately begin tinkering with code. It is a very approachable introduction to programming, but is not particularly useful for an already-competent programmer.

#### Google
Google's Python class teaches Python for people with a little bit of experience with some programming language. It progresses from basic concepts to "full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections". Video lectures, text materials, and exercises combine to form the course's material. This course does not focus specifically on scientific applications of Python.

#### 10th Resource: [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index/html)
The official Python tutorial aims to introduce "Python's most noteworthy features" and provide a starting point for new Python programmers. It assumes the reader is already proficient with general programming concepts. This tutorial is useful for getting started with Python but does not specifically cover scientific applications.

### Best Suited
Of these resources, these seem of the most use to me:

* **Physical Modeling**: This book starts at a a basic level of programming and covers specifically the kinds of applications I expect to find most useful. I don't need any additional foundational knowledge to approach this book.
* **Scipy Lectures**: I expect these lecture notes to be useful once I have a basic grasp of Python and need to go looking for specific tools insice Numpy, Scipy, and other libraries to complete projects. 
* **Everyone Exploring Data**: This book could be useful for me to learn about topics above and beyond the very basics, like regular expressions, networking, and object-oriented programming.

### Additional resources from classmates
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](www.learnpythonthehardway.org)
* MIT Open Courseware 6.001, 6.002, etc.: better foundation, but takes longer
* **Gray Hat Python**, a book for learning how low-level stuff works with Python
* Stack Overflow for help with particular problems that others have also encountered
* **Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python**, John Guttag

### Additional notes from in class, Sept 25
* "Everyone Exploring Data" focuses a lot on databases, and assumes some programming knowledge
* "Whirlwind tour" is very short and includes examples
* "Scipy lectures" has a scientific focus, is a good reference
* "Fluent Python" is for learning to write *good* Python code once you know how to write some Python code.
* **Take-home**: There's a range of resources, suited for different levels of proficiency
