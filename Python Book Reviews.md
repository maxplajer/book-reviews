# Python Book Reviews

Maximilian Plajer

#### Everyone Exploring Data
*Python for Everybody* begins by introducing the Python language and basic concepts of programming like conditional execution, functions, and loops. It then moves into more advanced topics like networked programs and object-oriented programming.

This book is a good resource for a highly-motivated beginner to Python who may have little or no experience with programming. It seems to do a good job of overviewing the functionality of Python, but it does not focus on any specific applications of the language.

#### Fluent
*Fluent Python* is written for competent Python programmers with the aim of teaching them specifically to code "fluently" in Python 3 - that is, to use Python-specific features that might be unfamiliar because they are not present in other programming languages. As the author notes in the preface, this book is not useful for Python beginners because it assumes a reasonable level of proficiency from the reader.
