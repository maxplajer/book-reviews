# Python Book Reviews

Maximilian Plajer

## Everyone Exploring Data
"Python for Everybody" begins by introducing the Python language and basic concepts of programming like conditional execution, functions, and loops. It then moves into more advanced topics like networked programs and object-oriented programming.

This book is a good resource for a highly-motivated beginner to Python who may have little or no experience with programming. It seems to do a good job of overviewing the functionality of Python, but it does not focus on any specific applications of the language.
